# NLCONTROL - Nonlinear Control toolbox

## Description
A Python toolbox extending simupy for Nonlinear control. A focus lies on underactuated systems with a Euler-Lagrange formulation. A controller is added with linear and non-linear features. The non-linear controller part is given in an Euler-Lagrange formulation as well.
