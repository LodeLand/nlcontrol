Welcome to nlcontrol's documentation!
=====================================

Nlcontrol is a comprehensive library for simulating nonlinear control loops with Python. The toolbox is developed to be used by people who are not shy to dive into Python code, as well as for users who are just interested in results.

The toolbox is far from complete, so contribute your own systems and controllers, based on the base classes. This allows easy integration in the closed loop class.

.. note:: This module is originally developed in the Dynamical Systems & Control group of Ghent University.
